  <h1>Walkthrough</h1>
  <p>
    If you're wanting to write your own modules to talk to sensors/actuators, this walkthrough will get you up and running as quickly as possible. See the other Module sub-headings for more comprehensive information.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is possible to modify code directly on the Ninja Block, or on any machine. If you're directly modifying code within the Ninja Block, start from step 2, and remember to keep backups of your modifications in a directory other than /opt/ninja.
  </p>
  <h2>Step 1: Setup Node.js and client code</h2>
  <p>
    On any device that can run node follow <a href=http://ninjablocks.com/blogs/how-to/7195176>these instructions</a>. Running node (node client.js) is the equivalent of what the service 'ninjablock' does on the actual Ninja Block hardware.<br />
  <br />
    Note: Disregard errors about /dev/tty01 (arduino). Within the Ninja Block, tty01 is the arduino-cape as seen by the beagle-bone. (If you wish to use an arduino with your client you can see <a href=http://ninjablocks.com/blogs/how-to/7192604>here</a>)
    For those interested in a high-level overview, <a href=http://help.ninjablocks.com/customer/portal/articles/960364>see here</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Step 2: Installing ninja-toolbelt and setting up a new module</h2>
  <p>
    Follow the install instructions <a href=https://github.com/ninjablocks/ninja-toolbelt/blob/master/README.md>here</a> to install the toolbelt.<br/>
    <br/>
    Now go to the sub-directory ninja_modules<br />
    Note: On the Ninja Block hardware, the client code is in the directory /opt/ninja/, otherwise it is where you checked it out.<br />
    <br />
    When creating your module (ninja create [module name]), follow the instructions for 'ninja create', and then onwards with the instructions for 'npm init'<br />
    Note: For 'npm init' most default options should suffice (just hit enter).<br />
    <br />
    If you've not created a README.md file, you will receive a warning, but this can be done later.<br />
    <br />
    Note: if you're running the client code on hardware other than the Ninja Block, restarting the ninjablock service is the equivalent to re-running the client code (node client.js) from the base 'client' directory.
  </p>
  <h2>Step 3: Verifying the module template</h2>
  <p>
    By default the device ID will be set to 2000 ([client base]/ninja_modules/[module name]/lib/device.js), and assuming that you've already paired you block, this will be presented on the dashboard in a device titled "Sandbox".
  </p>
  <h1>What next?</h1>
  <p>
    Now you can modify your module to read/write to the hardware that you wish to present as devices.<br />
    Then create different device.js files for the devices that you intend to sense/actuate from the Ninja Platform.
